# Accessibility and Accommodations

## Modern Web Programming (COMP 426)

### Accommodation plans

If you have an accommodation plan, please feel welcomed to make an appointment with the professor if you would like to discuss it.

#### A note from the instructor about accessibility and accommodation

> I would like to make sure that we are honoring your plan and doing whatever we can to make the course accessible and equitable.
> 
> Most likely, I will simply incorporate accommodations into the course design.
> This way, we increase the accessibility of the course in a general sense.
> 
> I believe that it is my responsibility as instructor to make sure that your needs are met. The ARS office is the university's mechanism for maintaining minimal compliance with ADA and managing liability. I believe that we can do so much more and I will strive to do so.

### Accessibility Resources

The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill facilitates the implementation of reasonable accommodations, including resources and services, for students with disabilities, chronic medical conditions, a temporary disability or pregnancy complications resulting in barriers to fully accessing University courses, programs and activities.

Accommodations are determined through the Office of Accessibility Resources and Service (ARS) for individuals with documented qualifying disabilities in accordance with applicable state and federal laws. 
See the ARS Website for contact information: https://ars.unc.edu or email ars@unc.edu.
