## Accessibility Resources

The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill facilitates the implementation of reasonable accommodations, including resources and services, for students with disabilities, chronic medical conditions, a temporary disability or pregnancy complications resulting in barriers to fully accessing University courses, programs and activities.

Accommodations are determined through the Office of Accessibility.
Resources and Service (ARS) for individuals with documented qualifying disabilities in accordance with applicable state and federal laws. 
See the ARS Website for contact information: https://ars.unc.edu or email ars@unc.edu.

### Accommodation plans

If you have an accommodation plan, please feel welcomed to make an appointment or come to instructor office hours to discuss it.
I would like to make sure that we are honoring your plan.

Most likely, I will work to incorporate accommodations into the course design.
This way, we increase the accessibility of the entire course, for everyone.
