# Attendance and participation

## Modern Web Programming (COMP 426)

Attendance in class sessions is expected but does not have to always be in-person.

**_If you are sick, with anything, for any reason: DO NOT COME TO CLASS!_**

There are immunocompromised people in our community. Have respect for them and yourselves: stay home and get well before returning to class in-person. This is why we have made remote accessibilty and archived sessions a priority. There is absolutely NO reason that you should feel compelled to come to this class if you are not well.

There will be interactive components in the class sessions and you will need to interact with other students on occasion. We are attempting to make all such interactions possible remotely as well as in class. We will work together to find alternatives if something does not work. 

### Taking attendance: A note from your professor on why I will never do it

> We will not be taking attendance. Nobody has time for that. There are hundreds of students in this class. You are all adults. You are presumably taking this class to learn new things. You will only get out of the class what you put into it.
> 
>I trust that you will make every effort to attend class sessions and engage with the class.
>
>It is to your benefit to do so.
>
>Plus, if I took attendance every session, people will come up with ways to try to scam that system. I have no interest in dealing with that.
> 
> A final note about attendance: if you have read all of the above and your takeaway is some version of, "Oh, there is no attendance grade, so that means I don't have to come to class," then do us both a favor and drop the course immediately. No one has time for that. You're not going to have a good time in this course if you think like this.

### What is participation in a class like this?

Participation in this course means engaging with the course materials, coming to lectures, but possibly most importantly: interacting with the GitHub Organization site.

This is the locus of all of your activity for the course.

- It is where all the course information is stored.
- It is where announcements will be made.
- It is where discussions will be held. 
- It is the place where all of your code repositories will live. 
- It is the place where you will do planning for projects and collaborative work. 
- It is where you will raise issues you are having with your code, etc.
- It is a plae to try new things, learn what suceeds and fails, and incorporate that knowledge.

This is why we are using a GitHub organization to manage every aspect of the course.
Our goal is to get you _very_ comfortable using a platform like GitHub so that when you leave UNC and get and job, etc., you will be a better, more engaged collaborator.

If you have something to say, put it in the GH org discussions. Don't use GroupMe or some other third-party tool. That doesn't help anyone, least of all you.

So, use it. Also, we can see all of your activity in the audit log and will use this as the basis for your engagenment score for the class.
