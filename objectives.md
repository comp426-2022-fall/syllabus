### Technical skills

Working through this course facliltates students to exercise a range of skils:

- Design and build RESTful API endpoints for access to a server-side information source (database, third-party API, etc.)
- Design objects using the JavaScript prototype-based object model
- Employ functional programming techniques implemented in JavaScript for asynchronous event-handling
- Use asynchronous techniques to implement client-server interactions with a RESTful API
- Manipulate the Document Oject Model (DOM) using a variety of techniques for presenting information client-side
- Construct client-side/browesr-based interactive applications/interfaces
- Use CSS and HTML for basic aesthetics in interface design

### Planning and management skills

In addition to the above, students will be able to:

- Manage source code using git and GitHub
- Basic package structure using Node.js
- Jump-start prototyping with JS libraries like React, Next.js, and Express and CSS frameworks like Bulma and Bootstrap
- Plan and manage projects while collaborating with a team
- Ask design questions for basic interaction flows
