# Grade breakdown

## Modern Web Programming (COMP 426)

Grading will be based on 1,000,000 points.
The breakdown is as follows.

| **Component** | **Description** | **Quantity** | **Points** | **Subtotal** |
|:--- |:--- | ---:| ---:| ---:|
| Assignments | Individual programming assignments | 10 | 50,000 | 500,000 |
| Final project | Team-based app development | 1 | 300,000 | 300,000 |
| Exams | Questionnaires | 3 | 50,000 | 150,000 |
| Engagement | GitHub commits | 100 | 500 | 50,000 | 
| **Total** |   |   |   | **1,000,000** |

## Components

### Assignments

Each of the individual programming assignments will be worth 50,000 points and will be automatically evaluated.

The GitHub actions workflow will run some checks against your code. Most of these are tests that you will have written yourself.

The grade is not the point of any of this. Writing working code is the point of this.

#### Assignment due dates

The assignment due dates are meant as guideposts, not deadlines.

You can always submit or resubmit the assignments (by pushing them to your GitHub repository) after the due date. 

You will not lose points for pushing or updating your repos after the due date has passed, ever.

### Final project points breakdown

| Component | Description | Points |
|:--- |:--- | ---:|
| Group planning | Documentation of your planning process (e.g. Discussions in GitHub repo, Projects board) | 100,000 |
| API | Back-end API has defined endpoints that you can make queries against. | 50,000 |
| Interface | Front-end connects to and interacts with API endpoints and stores/retrieves user or other information. | 50,000 |
| API documentation | There is documentation about your API endpoints and how they work. This also includes code comments. | 50,000 |
| User documentation | Instructions for users. This can include demos and walkthroughs. | 50,000 |
| **Total**  |   | **300,000** |

Every member of your team will receive the same number of points for the final project.

Your team's project must have the five components above. 

You will check in with a TA assigned to your team throughout the semester as you plan and build.
We will give you qualitative feedback on your work throughout and as part of the final presentation.

### Exams

An exam/assessment given at the beginning, middle, and end of the semester.

### Engagement

Your engagement score is a count of your GitHub commits.
I am gathering this directly from your GitHub repositories submitted for your assignments and your team's final project repos.

I will gather these counts to encourage you to commit small changes meaning that there should be a lot of them.

The number that you are responsible for is actually relatively few.
You should easily be able to record over 100 commits over the course of the semester across 10 assignments and the final project.

In fact, you should have WAY more than that if you are using Git and GitHub properly throughout the semester.
