Resources for conceptual information and technical documentation will all be linked in the session notes in the schedule-and-notes repository.

All assigned resources will be open educational resources or otherwise available online.

#### Recommended readings

A great resource for learning to challenge yourself and the ways you think and do things is _Conceptual Blockbusting_ by James L. Adams: 

Adams, J. L. (2019). Conceptual blockbusting: A guide to better ideas (5th ed.). Basic Books.

You can find it any any online retailer or books, or order it from one of our excellent local bookshops, [Epilogue](https://epiloguebookcafe.com/) or [Flyleaf Books](https://www.flyleafbooks.com/).

You can also find it in other places on the Internet. 

### Tutorials

This is a class that will use JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, but it is not a class that is meant to teach these things specifically.
It is more about learning what we can do with them.

As such, Google is your friend, but also there are some excellent resources available that have extensive tutorials. The following are some of the best resources you will find:
