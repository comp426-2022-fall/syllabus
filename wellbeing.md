# Mental Health and Well-being

## Modern Web Programming (COMP 426)

It's important to take care of your emotional and mental health and well-being. 

You cannot learn things if you are in distress. 

There are resources available to you and we can help you find them.

### Help us help you

If you are struggling, speak to a TA and/or the instructor.

We can and will make adjustments that will help you to better cope and thrive in this class.

Things are hard. You are not alone.
