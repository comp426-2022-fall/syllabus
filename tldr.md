### What is this class?

- This is a class about building things that make the web go. 
- We're going to learn how to do that by doing that. 
- We use an array of langauges and tools as needed.

### What ISN'T this class? 

- This is not a class about HTML+CSS or JavaScript or any specific language or thing in particular. 
- It's not about one thing. 
- It's about making a bunch of things work together.

### I heard this class is super easy?

- Yah it's super easy if you can follow instructions, read documentation, and Google error messages.
- It's also easy if you like figuring things out.

### I heard this class is hard?

- Yeah, it's really, really hard if you hate figuring things out.
- It's hard if you refuse to follow instructions.
- It is also really hard if you refuse to read documentation or Google error messages.

### Is there an attendance or participation grade

- LOL no.
- Seriously nobody has time for that. 
- Just come to class.
- BUT:
- **_If you are sick AT ALL IN ANY WAY, then DO NOT COME TO CLASS IN PERSON._**
- Log into Zoom or watch the sessions later instead.

### What are we going to learn about?

- We will learn some command line sorcery.
- We will learn to collaborate. Like actually learn the skills necessary.
- We will learn about open source development and licenses. 
- We will learn to use a bunch of Node.js packages and write a bunch of JavaScript.
- We will learn to build and use RESTful APIs.
- We will learn to build front-end interfaces using JS, HTML, and CSS to send and retrieve information to and from an API/back-end, respectively.

### What are the assignments?

- There is a series of individual assignments intended to help you develop the skills necessary for working on your final project assignment. 
- You will work in a team on a final project application that deals with public health information, which you will begin planning in the second week of class.

### What about grades?

- Grading will be done on a scale of 1,000,000 points. Literally.
- Grading will also be done by robots.
- You will write some of the instructions for the robots to grade your stuff. 
- Grades are really not the point at all.

### Are there exams? 

- Yeah, but they are not really like the exams you are used to.
- The exams assess familiarity with concepts and are really an assessment of my teaching rather than your ability to memorize things.

### What will class be like?

- Sometimes I will talk about conceptual stuff on slides.
- Sometimes I will do live demos of things related to your assignments.

### How do we do things?

- We will use GitHub.
- We will talk about open source and licensing.
- We will learn how to work collaboratively.

### CTRL+C CTRL+V?

- Do your own work (but ask for help when you need it). 
- Do original work (but find things that inspire you and build on them). 
- Don't plagiarize existing work (seriously, don't). 
- Reference things that you find useful. 
- Follow the license terms of any code you adapt and identify where it comes from.

### \*sigh\* Everything is a lot right now. Will it ever get better?

- Mental health and general well-being are important.
- We can't learn anything if we are beset at all sides by stress.
- We have to tke care of ourselves and each other or we are nowhere.
- Be kind to one another and the instructional staff.
- The instructional staff will be kind to you and we'll all learn some interesting stuff this semester. 

### I thought the course was about something else entirely and I'm mad about it

- Oh no... I don't care.
- It's SUPER DUPER EASY to drop this class if you don't like it.
