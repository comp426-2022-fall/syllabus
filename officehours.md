# Office hours

## Modern Web Programming (COMP 426)

All members of the instructional staff will hold office hours at different times throughout the week. 
This will likely be remote-only at the beginning of the semester, but there may be an in-person option offered by some if we can secure a space in Sitterson Hall to hold them.

**IMPORTANT: _You must create an issue about what you need help with BEFORE joining office hours. This is so that the staff can have all the information they need in order to help you. If you have not created an issue, you will be asked to do so and returned to the queue._**

Office hours will be listed in the table below and updated when there are changes.
