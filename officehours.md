# Office hours

## Modern Web Programming (COMP 426)

All members of the instructional staff will hold office hours at different times throughout the week. 
This will likely be remote-only, but there may be an in-person option offered by some if we can secure a space in Sitterson Hall to hold them.

Office hours will be listed in the table below.

| Day of week | Time | Name | Format | Location | 
|:--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |
|  |  |  |  |
