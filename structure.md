# Course structure

## Modern Web Programming (COMP 426)

### Class sessions

We will combine demonstrations and lectures with hands-on work in class.
Some class time will be reserved for you to work with your teams. 

### Remote availability

Class sessions are all going to be available to stream live on Zoom.
This is intended to help manage dealing with ongoing uncertainty regarding... well, everything.

### Session recordings

Sessions will all be recorded and archived in Panopto so that you can access them later.
