# Required software

## Modern Web Programming (COMP 426)

In this course we will use the following software, which you are responsible for downloading and installing on your system.

It is expected, given that you are computer science students, that you understand how to download and install software.

### About software choices

Many of you will have habits or established ways of doing certain things. That is fine. 

Think of this course, though, as an opportunity to add new tools to your toolbox. Some of these, you may already familiar and comfortable with. With others, you may be using them for the first time ever.

Give it time. Do the work. This is a university course: it's meant to be challenging and expand your skills

### Tools we will use

- bash (comes preinstalled on MacOS/Linux)
- [Vim](https://www.vim.org/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node Version Manager (NVM)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- Node.js (NVM installs this)
- [curl](https://curl.se/)

#### For Windows users

You win! It's your lucky day! You get to become Linux users. 

This course requires that you install the Windows Subsystem for Linux. You will install and run this from a command shell.

Once you have installed it, you will be able to install all of the above using WSL and it will be just like you are using Linux, because you are.

What is it? It is a Linux compatiblity layer that runs on top of your Windows installation. It is very lightweight. Most importantly: it gives you access to a Linux/Unix development environment. 

Don't worry. This is going to be fun.

#### For MacOS users

Congratulations! You will be able to install all of the above software without issue. Some of it will already be installed on your system by default, even. Yay!

#### For Linux users

Welcome home.

### Tools we will not use

- VSCode
- Sublime Text
- Atom
- Any GUI ever

> What do I mean when I say we're not going to use the above list of tools?
> 
> I mean that I will not be doing any demonstrations using any of that software and we will not support its use for troubleshooting problems with your code. 
> 
> It is incredibly important that you learn to use a command shell and become comfortable with command line operation. It is important that you learn to run in "headless" environments, i.e. environments without a GUI. 
> 
> GUIs make us lazy and obscure error and other system messages from our view. 
> 
> So, you're going to learn to do things the hard way, which is also the way that makes it easier for you to look like a stone cold professional. You can go back to using GUIs later, but you'll always know how to find your way around a headless environment.

> You're welcome.
