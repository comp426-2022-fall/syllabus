# Exams

## Modern Web Programming (COMP 426)

There will be several exams throughout the course.

The first of these will happen in the first week of the semester. 

You will take a questionnaire at the beginning of the course that gives us a baseline for your familiarity with certain tools and concepts. This also provides the instructional staff with basic information about you, like your GitHub username, so that we can add you to the course organization properly.

There will also be midterm and final questionnaires, but they will not assess specific knowledge in the way a traditional exam does.
Instead they will assess your familiarity with concepts and tools that we are using in the course and allow us to compare across the semester.

| Exam | Purpose | Form | Points |
|:--- |:--- |:--- | ---:|
| e00 | Beginning: establish a baseline for skills and topic familiarity| GitHub Classroom + Questionnaire | 50,000 |
| e01 | Midterm: progress and check-in | GitHub Classroom + Questionnaire | 50,000 |
| e02 | Final: self- and team-assessment | GitHub Classroom + Questionnaire | 50,000 |

The midterm and final will include a self-assessment component and also an assessment of your team dynamics.

These assessments are designed to evaluate our teaching effectiveness as much as they are designed to assess your skill and familiarity with concepts and tools.
