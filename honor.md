# The UNC Honor Code

## Modern Web Programming (COMP 426)

### Honor Code

The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill has had a student-led honor system for over 100 years. Academic integrity is at the heart of Carolina and we all are responsible for upholding the ideals of honor and integrity. The student-led Honor System is responsible for adjudicating any suspected violations of the Honor Code and all suspected instances of academic dishonesty will be reported to the Honor System. Information, including your responsibilities as a student, is outlined in the Instrument of Student Judicial Governance. Your full participation and observance of the Honor Code are expected.

The full text of the Honor Code is available here: https://catalog.unc.edu/policies-procedures/honor-code/

Your continued participation in this course is an agreement to observe the UNC Honor Code.

### Don't plagiarize your work

This is simple. Very straightfoward.

The ONE RULE in The Academy that you absolutely cannot violate is this: do your own work and do not take credit for someone else's work. 

Without this, everything breaks down and we are nowhere.

#### What does this mean for a programming class where we are encouraging collaboration?

It means that you should do original work in concert with other members of your group.

Assign credit appropriately.

Help each other learn how to do things.

On individual assignments, you should be writing your own code.
But if you need help, then seek it out.

#### Do not copy + paste code from the Internet.

If you are inspired by open source code, then make a reference to the source in a comment.
If you adapt open source code, then adhere to its license and make sure that your work is licensed appropriately.

### Mutual responsibilities

> The faculty responsibility section of the Honor Code documentation is a list of very specific duties, mostly related to conducting examinations. We will make sure all of that happens.
> 
> But beyond that, I promise, as your instructor, to provide an equitable space for learning and ensure that you have every opportunity to thrive in it.
> 
> I ask, in return, only that you show up, keep your mind open, and incorporate knowledge gained from mistakes and failures so that you might see them instead as opportunities to broaden your horizons.
> 
> And be kind. We're all working with a lot. It's easier if we work together instead of against one another.
